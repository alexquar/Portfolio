      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        I am a passionate Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo just outside my hometown, Cambridge, Ontario. I am a
        hard-working leader who believes anything can be accomplished with organization, determination and a great deal of collaboration.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        I have been writing code for over 5 years now and have a plethora of experience through work, design teams, school, independant study, tutoring and personal projects. I love learning new things and I am always looking to experience something new and interesting!
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        In my personal life I am a massive sports fan, tech enthousiast, chef, movie critic and animal lover. My love of sports is for, but not limited to hockey, baseball, football, swimming, golf, frisbee, skiing and more.
        I have two cats named Harry and Hermione and a lovely golden retriever named Gryff. I love to cook anything, and if an idea is given to me I have to give it a try. I love movies so much and some of my favorites are discussed right here on my blog.
