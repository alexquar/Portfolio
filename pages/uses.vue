    I am often asked about the gear I use as a software developer and content creator. The hardware and software I use is
    changing all the time so this page will serve as a place for an updated list. If you have a question about anything I
    use or a suggestion for something I am missing please reach out to me on. Valuable technical skills I have include, but are not limited to C/C++/C#, Javascript/TypeScript, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, SCSS/SASS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Vue, Nuxt, Django, MongoDB, MySQL, GraphQL, Firebase, Git, Github, Netlify.
